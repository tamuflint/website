6/27/25 - Jayden - Fixed various issues

6/27/25 - Dreux - Built basic webserver in Rust using Rocket.rs, can serve the files located in the frontend folder. Currently does not work with assets.

6/25/25 - Jayden - Moved CSS in James' code to a sepearte file. All the JS is included when the Bootstrap framework is linked to in lines 276-277.

6/24/25 (ish) - James - Created a buildteams webpage using the Bootstrap 4.6.2 CSS framework. Simple yet descriptive on what FLiNT does.

6/18/25 - Jayden - Put all CSS and JS into seperate files to get a better idea of project flow. 

6/17/25 - James - Made a better template that includes some cool JS and CSS.

6/13/25 - Jayden - Uploaded some assets and started work on creating a button interface for the socials. Animating this button in css will be using the .icon class and will be next on the chopping block after I get the images to work.

6/27/25 - Dreaux - Early backend changes, created this changelog file and made some documentation updates.

6/28/25 - Jayden - Removed the hotbar for the build team showcase page and replaced it with buttons similar to the ones used on the homepage. I did this by copying the cover-nav classes over to buildteams_style.css. I left the original hotbar in the code if we ever to choose to go back. I also replaced the FLiNT logo and seek to eventually add an easter egg.
