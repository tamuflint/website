# How to use this directory

This directory will store any documentation for the time being for the project.

The more detailed our documentation of the project, the better.

6/13/25 - Jayden - Uploaded some assets and started work on creating a button interface for the socials. Animating this button in css will be using the .icon class and will be next on the chopping block after I get the images to work.

6/17/25 - James - Made a better template that includes some cool JS and CSS.

6/18/25 - Jayden - Put all CSS and JS into seperate files to get a better idea of project flow. 

6/24/25 (ish) - James - Created a buildteams webpage using the Bootstrap 4.6.2 CSS framework. Simple yet descriptive on what FLiNT does.

6/25/25 - Jayden - Moved CSS in James' code to a sepearte file. All the JS is included when the Bootstrap framework is linked to in lines 276-277.
